        <h1>From my heart</h1>
        <p>
            In the halls of our shared past,
            From our Year 1 days that flew so fast,
            <br>
            Through laughter, tears, and childish fights,
            We've grown together, reaching greater heights.
            <br><br>
            
            Though words unsaid may fill the air,
            Know my love for you is always there,
            <br>
            In every smile, every shared glance,
            In moments of joy and in the dance.
            <br><br>
            
            We've weathered storms, our bond so strong,
            Through arguments, righting every wrong,
            <br>
            For in the end, it's clear to see,
            Our friendship is a cherished decree.
            <br><br>
            
            So on this day, your special day,
            I send my love in every way,
            <br>
            For you, my friend, mean more than words can say,
            Happy Birthday, in every possible way.
            <br><br>
        </p>
